FootyCompare Utilizes Java, React.js, and React libraries to allow any manager to quickly and easily make statistics based decisions between two football (soccer) players, regardless of their position on the field. Whether playing fantasy with friends or trying to increase your odds of winning money, FootyCompare can provide the quick analysis you need. The project was a final submission for Computer Programming II and uses all the pillars of Object-Oriented Programming.
